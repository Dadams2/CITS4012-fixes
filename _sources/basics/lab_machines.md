Use Lab Machines
================

Our labs support dual boot into either Window 10 or Redhat 7. Depending on which OS you prefer, you can follow the below instructions to activate the environment. However, please note these are *un-writable environments*. It is not possible to install new packages during the semester, as our IT team maintains a university-wide image. Installation during semester may disturb the global computing environment.

It is useful if you want some spare CPUs to train your model as the lab machines have decent CPU processing power, while carrying out other activities on your own devices.
