Lab05: Introduction to Neural Networks and Pytorch
===================================================
In this lab, we will introduce the basic training steps of neural networks by starting with simple linear models in Numpy. Then we will introduce basic Pytorch data types, and non-linearity by looking into activation functions, to pave the way for our future labs.
