Lab05: Introduction to Neural Networks and Pytorch
===================================================
In this lab, we will introduce the basic training steps of neural networks by starting with simple linear models in Numpy. Then we will introduce basic Pytorch data types, and re-implement the linear model in Pytorch. A number of important Pytorch functions are introduced in this lab.

The Linear Models in Numpy/Pytorch notebooks are adapted from: [Deep Learning in Pytorch Step by Step Chapter 1 notebook on Github](https://github.com/dvgodoy/PyTorchStepByStep/blob/master/Chapter01.ipynb)
