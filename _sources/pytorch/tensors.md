* A tensor of order zero is just a number, or a `scalar`.
* A tensor of order one (1st-order tensor) is an array of numbers, or a `vector`.
* A tensor of order two (2nd-order tensor) is an array of vectors, or a `matrix`.
* A tenosr of order n (nth-order tensor) is a generalised n-dimensional array of scalars. 

Google's Machine Learning Library TensorFlow was named after them.
