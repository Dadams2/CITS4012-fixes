Implement the code of lecture notes on dependency parsing. 

Imagine you are building a chat bot and we are trying to find utterances in user input that express one of the following: 

```{tabbed} What's Expressed
ability, possibility, permission, or obligation (as opposed to utterances that describe real actions that have occurred, are occurring, or occur regularly)
```
```{tabbed} Example Sentences
For instance, we want to find “I can do it.”
but not “I’ve done it.”
```
```{tabbed} Linguistic Pattern
`subject + auxiliary + verb + . . . + direct object + ...`

The ellipses indicate that the direct object isn't necessarily
located immediately behind the verb, there might be other words in between.
