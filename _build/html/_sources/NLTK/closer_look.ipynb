    "The basic form of Python statements is: `variable = expression`. Python will evaluate the expression, and save its result to the variable. This process is called assignment. It does not generate any output; you have to type the variable on a line of its own to inspect its contents. The equals sign is slightly misleading, since information is moving from the right side to the left. It might help to think of it as a left-arrow. The name of the variable can be anything you like, e.g., my_sent, sentence, xyzzy. It must start with a letter, and can include numbers and underscores. Here are some examples of variables and assignments:\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "It is good to choose meaningful variable names to remind you — and to help anyone else who reads your Python code — what your code is meant to do. Python does not try to make sense of the names; it blindly follows your instructions, and does not object if you do something confusing, such as `one = 'two'` or `two = 3`. The only restriction is that a variable name cannot be any of Python's reserved words, such as `def`, `if`, `not`, and `import`. If you use a reserved word, Python will produce a syntax error:"
